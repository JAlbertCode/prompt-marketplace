### Stores
- `useUnlockedFlowStore`: Zustand store for tracking which flows a user has unlocked

### API Endpoints
- `/api/flows/unlock`: API route for handling flow unlock transactions
- `/api/credits/deduct`: API route for handling credit deductions when running prompts/flows
- `/api/user/unlocked-flows`: API route for fetching a user's unlocked flows

### Utilities
- `fetchUnlockedFlows`: Utility function to sync unlocked flows between server and client
