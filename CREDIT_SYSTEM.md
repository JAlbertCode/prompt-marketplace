# PromptFlow Credit System

This document outlines the credit system in PromptFlow, including the recent interface improvements and credit management features.

## Overview

PromptFlow uses a credit-based system where:
- 1 credit = $0.000001 USD
- $1 = 1,000,000 credits

Credits are used to run prompts, flows, and other operations on the platform. Different models have different credit costs based on prompt length and complexity.

### Key Features

   - One-click access to credit management

2. **Credit Pages**

## Credit Components

## Credit Transaction History

The transaction history page provides:
- Detailed record of all credit operations
- Filtering by time period
- Export functionality
- Visualization of usage patterns

## Usage Analytics

The usage analytics page shows:
- Model usage breakdown
- Usage over time (7/30/90 day views)

## Implementation Details

All credit components use the "use client" directive for client-side interactivity and follow Next.js App Router best practices. Credit information is loaded asynchronously with proper error handling to ensure the UI remains functional even if the credit system encounters issues.
