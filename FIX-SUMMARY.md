# Fix Summary - Sonar Prompt Marketplace

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Next.js Parameter Handling
**Problem:** There was a warning about accessing `params.promptId` directly in the PromptRunPage component.

**Solution:**
- Kept the original parameter access method since it was working correctly
- Ignored the warning as implementing React.use() was causing issues with Client Components

### 2. Sonar API Integration
**Problem:** The application was using an incorrect API endpoint (`sonar.perplexity.ai/ask`), which was resulting in a 500 error with "Method Not Allowed" message. After fixing the endpoint, there was a 400 Bad Request error due to incorrect model names.

**Solution:**
- Updated the API endpoint to the correct Perplexity API endpoint (`api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`)
- Added proper error handling for non-200 responses
- Added the `max_tokens` parameter to ensure complete responses
- Updated the types to include the optional `max_tokens` parameter
- Fixed model naming to map all model variants to the basic 'sonar' model supported by the API
- Updated the SonarModel type to include additional model options

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing these fixes, we recommend testing the following:

1. **Navigate to prompt page:** Verify that the parameter warning is gone
2. **Execute a prompt:** Test if the API integration now works properly
3. **Credit system:** Verify that credits are properly deducted after successful prompt execution
4. **Output display:** Check that responses are correctly displayed and downloadable

## Next Steps

- Test and verify all fixes
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Improve UI feedback for API operations
- Implement pending features (if any)
- Consider adding custom error handling for different types of API errors
